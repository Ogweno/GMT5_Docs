(33) 剖面叠加
-------------

The script produces the plot in Figure. Here
we demonstrate how :doc:`grdtrack </grdtrack>` can be
used to automatically create a suite of crossing profiles of uniform
spacing and length and then sample one or more grids along these
profiles; we also use the median stacking option to create a stacked
profile, showed above the map, with the gray area representing the
variations about the stacked median profile.


.. literalinclude:: ./ex033.sh
   :language: bash

.. figure:: ./ex033.*
   :width: 500 px
   :align: center

   Stacking automatically generated cross-profiles.
