.. _ex040:

(40) Line simplification
------------------------

This example demonstrate the Douglas-Peucker line simplification algorithm as
implemented in the tool :doc:`gmtsimplify </gmtsimplify>`.  We show the full
resolution coastline of Australia and two much simplified versions using two
different thresholds.

.. literalinclude:: ./ex040.sh
   :language: bash

.. figure:: ./ex040.*
   :width: 500 px
   :align: center

   Illustrate line simplification and area calculations.
