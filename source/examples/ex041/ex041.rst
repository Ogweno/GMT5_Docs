In this example we demonstrate how one can use the tool :doc:`pslegend </pslegend>`
to typeset a table within a legend.  It also shows how one would set up
variable-width columns and fill the cells with a background color.

.. literalinclude:: ./ex041.sh
   :language: bash

.. figure:: ./ex041.*
   :width: 500 px
   :align: center

   Illustrate typesetting legends that include tables.
