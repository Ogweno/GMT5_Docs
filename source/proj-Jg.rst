-Jg：Orthographic projection
============================

The orthographic azimuthal projection is a perspective projection from
infinite distance. It is therefore often used to give the appearance of
a globe viewed from outer space. As with Lambert's equal-area and the
stereographic projection, only one hemisphere can be viewed at any time.
The projection is neither equal-area nor conformal, and much distortion
is introduced near the edge of the hemisphere. The directions from the
center of projection are true. The projection was known to the Egyptians
and Greeks more than 2,000 years ago. Because it is mainly used for
pictorial views at a small scale, only the spherical form is necessary.

To specify the orthographic projection the same options **-Jg** or
**-JG** as the perspective projection are used, but with fewer variables to supply:

-  Longitude and latitude of the projection center.

-  Optionally, the horizon, i.e., the number of degrees from the center
   to the edge (<= 90, default is 90).

-  Scale as 1:xxxxx or as radius/latitude where radius is distance on
   map in inches from projection center to a particular
   oblique latitude (**-Jg**), or map width (**-JG**).

Our example of a perspective view centered on 75ºW/40ºN can therefore be
generated by the following :doc:`pscoast` command:

   ::

    gmt pscoast -Rg -JG-75/41/4.5i -Bg -Dc -A5000 -Gpink -Sthistle -P > GMT_orthographic.ps
