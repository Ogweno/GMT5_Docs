-Joï¼šOblique Mercator projection
================================

Oblique configurations of the cylinder give rise to the oblique Mercator
projection. It is particularly useful when mapping regions of large
lateral extent in an oblique direction. Both parallels and meridians are
complex curves. The projection was developed in the early 1900s by
several workers. Several parameters must be provided to define the
projection. GMT offers three different definitions:

#. Option **-Joa** or **-JOa**:

   -  Longitude and latitude of projection center.

   -  Azimuth of the oblique equator.

   -  Scale in inch/degree or 1:xxxxx along oblique equator (**-Joa**),
      or map width (**-JOa**).

#. Option **-Job** or **-JOb**:

   -  Longitude and latitude of projection center.

   -  Longitude and latitude of second point on oblique equator.

   -  Scale in inch/degree or 1:xxxxx along oblique equator (**-Job**),
      or map width (**-JOb**).

#. Option **-Joc** or **-JOc**:

   -  Longitude and latitude of projection center.

   -  Longitude and latitude of projection pole.

   -  Scale in inch/degree or 1:xxxxx along oblique equator (**-Joc**),
      or map width (**-JOc**).

Our example was produced by the command

   ::

   Oblique Mercator map using **-Joc**. We make it clear which direction is North by
   adding a star rose with the **-T** option.


It uses definition 3 for an oblique view of some Caribbean islands. Note
that we define our region using the rectangular system described
earlier. If we do not append an "r" to the **-R** string then the
information provided with the **-R** option is assumed to be oblique
degrees about the projection center rather than the usual geographic
coordinates. This interpretation is chosen since in general the
parallels and meridians are not very suitable as map boundaries.
