-Jwï¼šMollweide projection
=========================

This pseudo-cylindrical, equal-area projection was developed by the
German mathematician and astronomer Karl Brandan Mollweide in 1805.
Parallels are unequally spaced straight lines with the meridians being
equally spaced elliptical arcs. The scale is only true along latitudes
4044' north and south. The projection is used mainly for global maps
showing data distributions. It is occasionally referenced under the name
homalographic projection. Like the Hammer projection, outlined above, we
need to specify only two parameters to completely define the mapping of
longitudes and latitudes into rectangular *x*/*y* coordinates:

-  The central meridian [Middle of your map].

-  Scale along equator in inch/degree or 1:xxxxx (**-Jw**), or map width (**-JW**).

An example centered on Greenwich can be generated thus:
